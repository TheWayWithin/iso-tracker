## Product Overview

### What We Build

ISO Tracker is a specialized platform that combines:
1. **Real-time ISO tracking** - See current position of interstellar visitors in 60 seconds
2. **Evidence assessment framework** - Amateur-accessible tools to evaluate "alien vs. natural" claims
3. **Community analysis** - Compare Community Sentiment vs. Scientific Consensus
4. **Historical database** - Track and compare all known ISOs from 'Oumuamua forward
5. **Educational content** - Learn the methodology scientists use to analyze ISOs

### Strategic Positioning

**Core Value Proposition:**
> For people who want to understand interstellar objects, ISO Tracker is the only evidence-based analysis platform that helps you evaluate alien vs. natural claims yourself—unlike scattered Reddit threads, speculative Twitter debates, or inaccessible academic journals—so you can see the evidence, weigh expert takes, and meaningfully participate in humanity's search for alien life.

**Category Definition:** Interstellar Object Analysis Platform

We create a NEW category by being the only platform exclusively dedicated to ISOs with integrated tracking, evidence assessment, and community analysis. Not diluted with 29M stars (SkySafari), not passive news consumption (Space.com), not scattered speculation (Reddit/Twitter).

### The Evidence Framework (Primary Differentiator)

**Evidence Classification Hierarchy (System-Defined):**

Each piece of evidence is classified by its epistemic level:
- **Observation** (highest confidence): Direct measurements (trajectory, brightness, spectroscopy data)
- **Hypothesis** (testable speculation): Proposed explanations for observations
- **Theory** (validated framework): Well-supported scientific models

Evidence is also tagged by collection method: observation, spectroscopy, astrometry, photometry, radar, theoretical, simulation, literature.

**Two-Step Assessment Process (User-Performed):**

Evidence Analysts assess EACH piece of evidence:

**Step 1: Quality Rubric (1-5 scale each)**

1. **Chain of Custody Score (1-5)**
   - Primary source verification
   - Data provenance tracking
   - Cross-reference validation
   - Timestamp and attribution

2. **Witness Credibility Score (1-5)**
   - Observer qualifications
   - Observation methodology
   - Equipment specifications
   - Peer corroboration

3. **Technical Analysis Score (1-5)**
   - Trajectory data quality
   - Spectroscopic evidence
   - Statistical significance
   - Alternative explanations

**Step 2: Verdict and Confidence**

After completing the quality rubric:
- **Verdict:** alien | natural | uncertain (user's opinion on the ISO)
- **Confidence:** 1-10 scale (how certain they are)

**Dual Consensus Tracking:**

- **Community Sentiment:** Aggregate of user verdicts (% alien vs % natural vs % uncertain)
- **Scientific Consensus:** Quality scores from Evidence Analysts (weighted assessments)

This creates a unique "Debate Dashboard" showing how public perception compares to evidence-based analysis—our most compelling differentiation. The system classifies WHAT the evidence is; users assess HOW GOOD it is and WHAT IT MEANS.

## Risk Management

### Critical Risks & Mitigation Strategies

**1. Spectator → Debater Conversion Below 10%**

- **Risk:** Lifecycle model breaks if conversion <5% (marginal economics)
- **Impact:** Unsustainable unit economics, need external funding or pivot
- **Probability:** Medium (user behavior uncertain pre-launch)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Aggressive A/B testing of conversion prompts (Day 7, 30, 60, 90)
  - Evidence framework tutorial in onboarding (demonstrate value early)
  - "Unlock historical analysis" messaging (FOMO for 'Oumuamua comparisons)
  - 50% discount offers for first-month upgrades
  - Exit surveys for churned Event Pass users (learn objections)
- **Fallback:** Pivot to annual-only pricing ($99/year) if monthly conversion fails

**2. Limited ISO Detections (Gap Risk)**

- **Risk:** ISOs detected every 2-3 years (longer gaps than expected)
- **Impact:** Spectator acquisition slows, platform appears "dormant"
- **Probability:** Medium (unpredictable discovery frequency)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Content strategy: Historical deep dives keep platform active
  - Educational modules: "ISO Detection 101" provides ongoing value
  - Retention mechanics: Challenges, streaks, community events between ISOs
  - Diversified revenue: Classroom/Club plans less event-dependent
  - Marketing: Position as "permanent home" not just event tracker
- **Success Metric:** 40%+ users engage monthly with historical/educational content

**3. Solo Founder Burnout**

- **Risk:** Unsustainable workload, feature delays, quality degradation
- **Impact:** Customer churn, missed opportunities, health consequences
- **Probability:** High (solo development with $500/month budget)
- **Mitigation:**
  - AI-assisted development (Claude Code, Copilot, v0.dev)
  - No-code solutions: Discord (community), Stripe (payments), Supabase (backend)
  - Sustainable workflow: 2-3 hours daily, not 12-hour marathons
  - Community leverage: Power users moderate forums, contribute content
  - Ruthless scope management: MVP-first, defer "nice-to-have" features
- **Monitoring:** Weekly time tracking, monthly burnout self-assessment

**4. Data Accuracy Issues**

- **Risk:** Incorrect ISO positions, outdated trajectories, misinformation
- **Impact:** Loss of credibility, user churn, potential liability
- **Probability:** Low (NASA API is authoritative, well-maintained)
- **Mitigation:**
  - NASA JPL Horizons API (primary source, not scraped data)
  - Cross-reference with IAU Minor Planet Center
  - Academic advisor review (monthly data audits)
  - User reporting system (community flags inaccuracies)
  - Transparent data sources (show update timestamps, API version)
- **Commitment:** 100% data accuracy verified against NASA sources

**5. Competitor Fast-Follow**

- **Risk:** SkySafari adds ISO-specific features, Reddit creates dedicated ISO forum
- **Impact:** Loss of differentiation, price pressure, market share loss
- **Probability:** High (easy to copy features once validated)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Category ownership: First-mover SEO advantage (isotracker.org)
  - Evidence framework: Proprietary methodology (hard to replicate quality)
  - Community lock-in: Network effects increase with user base
  - Rapid iteration: Ship features faster than competitors
  - Brand loyalty: Build "home for ISO enthusiasts" identity
- **Defense:** Community and content moat (not just features)

**6. Technical Complexity Overwhelms Users**

- **Risk:** Evidence framework too complex, users confused or intimidated
- **Impact:** Poor onboarding conversion, high early churn, negative reviews
- **Probability:** Medium (balancing rigor with accessibility is hard)
- **Mitigation:**
  - "Grandmother test" UI (12-year-old can understand)
  - Progressive disclosure (simple → advanced pathways)
  - Interactive tutorials (guided evidence assessment walkthrough)
  - Plain English explanations (no jargon without definitions)
  - Video walkthroughs (5-minute "Evidence Framework 101")
- **Success Metric:** 85% can correctly explain evidence levels after onboarding

**7. Community Toxicity**

- **Risk:** Debates devolve into hostility, misinformation spreads, users leave
- **Impact:** Platform reputation damage, good users churn, moderation burden
- **Probability:** Medium (contentious "alien vs. natural" topic)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Community guidelines (evidence-first, respectful tone required)
  - Moderation tools (report system, timeout/ban capabilities)
  - Recognition system (reward quality contributions, not volume)
  - Filter mechanisms (mute, block features for users)
  - Power user moderators (community self-policing at scale)
- **Enforcement:** Zero tolerance for personal attacks, misinformation flagging

**8. Security Vulnerabilities**

- **Risk:** Data breaches, payment fraud, account hijacking
- **Impact:** Legal liability, user trust loss, regulatory fines (GDPR)
- **Probability:** Low (using battle-tested platforms)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Row-Level Security (RLS) on all Supabase tables
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) with strict nonces
  - Stripe webhook signature verification
  - Regular security audits (Dependabot, npm audit, Snyk)
  - HTTPS only, secure headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- **Commitment:** Security-first development (never compromise for convenience)
