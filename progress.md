## 🎓 Lessons Learned & Patterns

### Pattern #1: Incomplete Commit Scope
**Frequency**: High | **Impact**: Critical

**Recognition Signs**:
- User says "this was fixed in dev"
- Issues reappear after deployment
- Only partial files committed

**Prevention**:
1. Use `grep -r [pattern] apps/web/` to find ALL instances
2. Check related components (list view AND detail view)
3. Verify all files committed before marking complete

### Pattern #2: File Persistence Bug
**Frequency**: Rare | **Impact**: Critical

**Recognition Signs**:
- Agent reports "files created successfully"
- Post-completion: 0 files exist on filesystem

**Prevention**:
1. Prefer coordinator direct Write tool over Task delegation
2. Verify EVERY file with `ls -lh` immediately after creation
3. Document verification timestamps in progress.md

### Pattern #3: Lost Features (Uncommitted Work)
**Frequency**: Medium | **Impact**: Critical

**Recognition Signs**:
- Feature worked before but missing now
- No git history of feature

**Prevention**:
1. Commit immediately after implementing any feature
2. Never rely on "I'll commit this later"
3. Verify feature exists in git log before claiming completion

## 📋 Sprint 14a Extended - Email Signup Issue (Nov 24, 2025)

### Issue: Email Signup RLS Policy Violation

**What Happened**:
- 3i-atlas.live email signup form returned 500 error
- Error: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "email_signups"`
- Database table existed, RLS policies looked correct, grants were in place
- Direct SQL inserts worked, even with `SET ROLE anon`

**Root Cause**:
- API route used `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for server-side operation
- Server-side API routes should use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` instead
- Anon key is for client-side operations, service role is for trusted server operations

**Fix**:
- Changed `apps/web/app/api/email-signup/route.ts` to use service role key
- Service role bypasses RLS (correct for trusted server-side operations)
- Committed: `4087b94 - fix: Use service role key for email signup API to bypass RLS`

**Prevention**:
- Server-side API routes (`/app/api/*`) should use service role key
- Client-side components should use anon key
- Document this pattern in architecture.md

**Time Impact**: ~2 hours debugging (Nov 24)
