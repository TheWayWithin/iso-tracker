## 📦 Deliverables

### 2025-11-09 10:30 - Comprehensive Project Implementation Plan
**Created by**: coordinator
**Type**: Documentation
**Files**: `project-plan.md`

**Description**:
Created comprehensive 12-month implementation plan for ISO Tracker MVP with 4 phases (Phase 0: Environment Setup, Phase 1: Core MVP, Phase 2: Educational Content, Phase 3: Community Platform, Phase 4: Advanced Features). Plan includes detailed task breakdown for Phase 0 and Phase 1, success criteria for all milestones, risk mitigation strategies, and technology stack decisions (Supabase over Firebase, Stripe over Gumroad, Monorepo structure).

**Impact**:
- Provides complete roadmap from environment setup through 12-month launch
- Phase 0 establishes Dev/Staging/Production environments before coding begins
- Phase 1 prioritizes Evidence Framework Dashboard (core differentiator, not just tracking)
- Clear task ownership assigned to specialists (operator, architect, developer, etc.)
- Success metrics defined: 10% Spectator → Debater conversion, 50:1 LTV/CAC, <3s load time

### 2025-11-09 10:00 - Mission Context Preservation System
**Created by**: coordinator
**Type**: Infrastructure
**Files**: `agent-context.md`, `handoff-notes.md`, `progress.md`

**Description**:
Initialized mission context preservation system following AGENT-11 standards. Created three core files for maintaining zero context loss across multi-agent workflow.

**Impact**:
- Ensures all agents have complete mission context before starting work
- Prevents rework through comprehensive handoff documentation
- Establishes backward-looking changelog (progress.md) and forward-looking plan (project-plan.md)
- Enables pause/resume capability for mission continuity
