## 🎓 Lessons Learned & Patterns

### Pattern #1: Incomplete Commit Scope
**Frequency**: High | **Impact**: Critical

**Recognition Signs**:
- User says "this was fixed in dev"
- Issues reappear after deployment
- Only partial files committed

**Prevention**:
1. Use `grep -r [pattern] apps/web/` to find ALL instances
2. Check related components (list view AND detail view)
3. Verify all files committed before marking complete

### Pattern #2: File Persistence Bug
**Frequency**: Rare | **Impact**: Critical

**Recognition Signs**:
- Agent reports "files created successfully"
- Post-completion: 0 files exist on filesystem

**Prevention**:
1. Prefer coordinator direct Write tool over Task delegation
2. Verify EVERY file with `ls -lh` immediately after creation
3. Document verification timestamps in progress.md

### Pattern #3: Lost Features (Uncommitted Work)
**Frequency**: Medium | **Impact**: Critical

**Recognition Signs**:
- Feature worked before but missing now
- No git history of feature

**Prevention**:
1. Commit immediately after implementing any feature
2. Never rely on "I'll commit this later"
3. Verify feature exists in git log before claiming completion

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Sprint 11-15 PLANNED (Nov 23, 2025)
Created comprehensive sprint roadmap for all remaining PRD features:

| Sprint | Focus | Priority |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 11 | Community Arguments & Voting | HIGH |
| 12 | Evidence Tab & Comments | HIGH |
| 13 | ISO Following & Notifications | MEDIUM |
| 14 | Stripe Payments | CRITICAL |
| 15 | User Profile & Polish | MEDIUM |

**Key Findings During Planning**:
- `arguments` and `votes` tables do NOT exist yet (only referenced in migrations)
- Evidence components exist but aren't integrated into ISO detail pages
- Notification DB schema exists but no email backend (needs Resend)
- 3i-atlas.live email capture has no backend endpoint

**Recommended Order**: 11 → 14 → 12 → 13 → 15

See `project-plan.md` for full sprint details.
