## 1. Customer Analysis & Target Market

### 1.1 Primary Target Audience

**Core Customer:**
People who want to understand interstellar objects—from casual followers during exciting discoveries to evidence-minded analysts who stay engaged between events.

**Customer Journey Stages:**

**Stage 1: Spectators (Acquisition Stage)**
- **Demographics:** Space enthusiasts aged 18-65 following major ISO news
- **Behavior:** Check space news when major discoveries happen, share interesting stories
- **Pain Point:** "Where is 3I/ATLAS right now? Is it really alien?"
- **Solution Needed:** Simple tracking + quick evidence overview
- **Acquisition Channel:** Viral/organic during ISO detection events ($0 CAC)

**Stage 2: Debaters (Retention Stage)**
- **Demographics:** Evidence-minded analysts aged 25-65 who want intellectual rigor
- **Behavior:** Engage 2-3x per week, analyze evidence, participate in discussions
- **Pain Point:** "How do I evaluate these claims without a PhD? Need structured framework."
- **Solution Needed:** Evidence analysis framework + expert synthesis + historical context
- **Conversion Driver:** Evidence framework access between ISO events

**Three Primary Personas:**

1. **Ryan (Student Explorer, 18-22)**
   - College student, passionate about space, limited budget
   - Wants: Simple tracking without overwhelming complexity
   - Pain: Can't afford professional tools, doesn't know where to look
   - Success: "I found 'Oumuamua's path in 60 seconds and shared it with my astronomy club"

2. **David (Aerospace Enthusiast, 35)**
   - Works in tech/engineering, amateur astronomer with backyard telescope
   - Wants: Actionable observation windows, technical accuracy
   - Pain: Switching between 5 different apps/sites for complete picture
   - Success: "I captured my own photo of the ISO using Atlas coordinates"

3. **Mel (Retired Teacher, 60+)**
   - Lifelong space fan, follows news religiously, limited technical background
   - Wants: To understand what's happening without jargon
   - Pain: NASA technical language, scattered news sources
   - Success: "I finally understand what makes this object interstellar and why scientists are excited"

### 1.2 Market Segmentation & Economics

**Lifecycle-Based Market Model:**

**Spectator Acquisition (Event-Driven Funnel):**
- **Volume:** 80% of traffic during ISO detection events
- **Duration:** 3-6 month observation windows per ISO
- **CAC:** $0 (viral/organic from media coverage)
- **Conversion to Paid:** 5-10% → Event Pass subscribers @ $4.99/mo
- **Role:** Acquisition engine that feeds Debater pipeline

**Debater Retention (Ongoing Value):**
- **Volume:** 10-15% of Spectators convert and retain
- **Duration:** 12+ months between ISO events
- **LTV:** $228/year (Evidence Analyst tier)
- **Conversion from Spectators:** 10% target = sustainable economics
- **Role:** Revenue engine that sustains business between events

**Economic Model:**
```
Per ISO Event Cycle (Unit Economics):
├─ 1,000 Spectators acquired
├─ Blended CAC: $0.75 (content marketing time + community engagement)
├─ Total acquisition cost: $750
├─ 100 convert to Evidence Analysts (10% conversion)
├─ Event Pass revenue (3 months): $15,000
├─ Evidence Analyst revenue (12 months): $22,800
├─ Total revenue per cycle: $37,800
├─ Total LTV per 1,000 Spectators: $37,050 (after CAC)
└─ LTV/CAC ratio: 50:1 (sustainable at scale)
```

**Note:** While Spectator acquisition is primarily organic ($0 direct CAC), blended CAC accounts for time invested in content marketing, community engagement, and SEO—estimated at $0.50-$1.00 per Spectator acquired. This produces a grounded and defensible economic model.

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):** $47.7M
- 15% of $318M TAM (Debater segment only)
- Focus on evidence-minded analysts, not total space enthusiast market

**Geographic Focus:**
- **Phase 1 (Launch):** English-speaking markets (US, UK, Canada, Australia)
- **Phase 2 (6-12 months):** European expansion (multi-language support)
- **Phase 3 (12-24 months):** Global scale
