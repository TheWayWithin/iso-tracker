# Client Success Blueprint

**Business Name:** ISO Tracker by 3i-Atlas
**Date:** November 8, 2025
**Version:** 2.0
**Purpose:** Understanding who we serve and how to genuinely help them succeed

---

## Core Philosophy

This blueprint defines who we should focus on serving and how to genuinely help them achieve success. It drives all downstream business decisions: product design, marketing, sales, and support. The focus is on filtering IN the right people, filtering OUT the wrong people, and understanding how to create authentic value for those we serve.

**Core Insight:** We serve people who want to understand interstellar objects through evidence-first analysis, transforming casual spectators during ISO detection events into engaged debaters who value scientific rigor over sensationalism.
