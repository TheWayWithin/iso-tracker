## Executive Summary

**ISO Tracker** is the only evidence-based analysis platform dedicated exclusively to interstellar objects. We help people evaluate alien vs. natural claims through amateur-accessible frameworks, combining real-time tracking, evidence-based analysis, and community discussion so anyone can meaningfully participate in humanity's search for alien life.

**Core Value Proposition:** See the evidence. Weigh the expert takes. Cast your view—alien or natural?

**Strategic Positioning:** We create a new category ("Interstellar Object Analysis Platform") by being the only platform that provides evidence-based frameworks for evaluating ISO claims, bridging the gap between speculative social media and inaccessible academic sources.

## Product Vision

### Mission Statement

Dedicated exclusively to interstellar objects, we combine authoritative tracking, evidence-first discussion, and community collaboration so anyone can meaningfully participate in humanity's search for alien life.

### 25-Year Vision

Build the definitive platform tracking every known interstellar object, with 10 million active users contributing observations, analysis, and discussion in humanity's search for alien life.

### Core Values

**Intellectual Honesty:** Follow the data wherever it leads, admit what we don't know, never let wishful thinking cloud judgment.

**Curiosity Over Certainty:** Question everything, stay open to being wrong, embrace uncertainty as the path to discovery.

**Simplicity & Clarity:** Make complex ideas accessible to everyone without dumbing down the science.

**Rigorous Method:** Value systematic observation and testing over speculation.

**Collaborative Discovery:** Build on each other's work, recognize that collective intelligence exceeds individual brilliance.

- **Weaknesses:** Inaccessible to amateurs, paywalls, technical complexity
- **Our Advantage:** Amateur-accessible evidence framework, plain-English explanations

**SkySafari / Stellarium (Astronomy Apps)**
- **Strengths:** Comprehensive star charts, 29M celestial objects
- **Weaknesses:** ISOs buried in noise, no evidence evaluation tools, $40-80 price
- **Our Advantage:** ISO-exclusive focus, evidence framework, 4-8x cheaper

**Space.com / NASA App (News Platforms)**
- **Strengths:** Breaking news, authoritative sources
- **Weaknesses:** Passive consumption, no interactive evaluation, no tracking tools
- **Our Advantage:** Evaluate claims yourself, real-time tracking, community discussion

### Competitive Advantages

1. **Category Ownership:** Only evidence-based ISO analysis platform
2. **Evidence Framework:** Proprietary amateur-accessible methodology
3. **Lifecycle Integration:** Event hooks + ongoing retention value
4. **ISO-Exclusive Focus:** 0.00001% of astronomy (not diluted)
5. **Community Network Effects:** User-generated evidence analysis
6. **Timing Advantage:** Launch with 3I/ATLAS before next major ISO

## Open Questions & Future Considerations

1. **Institutional Licensing:** Create Education tier ($99/year, 30 student seats) and Club tier ($149/year, 50 member seats)?

2. **Citizen Science Pipeline:** Formalize user observations for professional astronomer contribution? Partnership opportunities with Vera Rubin Observatory?

3. **International Expansion:** Localization strategy for non-English markets? Which languages first (Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese)?

4. **Adjacent Product Opportunities:** Expand to near-Earth objects (NEOs), comets, or other rare astronomical events?

5. **Long-Term Sustainability:** If no new ISOs for years, can educational content and community sustain Debater retention?

6. **API Ecosystem:** Should we build third-party API access for educators, planetariums, science museums?

---

## Appendix: Glossary

**Interstellar Object (ISO):** Celestial body that originated outside our solar system, identified by hyperbolic trajectory (not gravitationally bound to Sun).

**Hyperbolic Trajectory:** Orbital path with eccentricity >1, indicating object will escape solar system rather than orbit Sun.

**Ephemeris:** Table of predicted positions of celestial object at regular time intervals.

**Right Ascension (RA) / Declination (Dec):** Celestial coordinate system equivalent to longitude/latitude on Earth's surface.

**Altitude/Azimuth:** Local coordinate system describing object position relative to observer's horizon and cardinal directions.

**Magnitude:** Brightness measurement; lower numbers = brighter (e.g., magnitude 3 brighter than magnitude 6).

**Evidence Hierarchy:** Framework for evaluating claims—Observation (direct measurement) > Hypothesis (testable speculation) > Theory (validated model).

**Scientific Consensus:** Current agreement among expert astronomers based on peer-reviewed research and validated observations.

**Spectator:** User in acquisition phase, event-driven engagement during ISO detections.

**Debater:** User in retention phase, evidence-minded analyst engaged between ISO events.
