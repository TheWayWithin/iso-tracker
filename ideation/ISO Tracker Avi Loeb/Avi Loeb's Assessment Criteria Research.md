## Overview
The Loeb Scale (formally the Interstellar Object Significance Scale - IOSS) is a 0-10 classification system for evaluating interstellar objects, extending the proven Torino Scale framework.

## Key Features
- **Scale Range:** 0-10 levels
- **Levels 0-3:** Natural phenomena (quantitative thresholds)
- **Levels 4-7:** Increasingly anomalous characteristics (graduated protocols)
- **Levels 8-10:** Confirmed artificial origin
- Each level specifies observable criteria and response protocols

## Test Case Applications
- **1I/'Oumuamua:** Level 4 (anomalous)
- **2I/Borisov:** Level 0 (natural)
- **3I/ATLAS:** Level 4 (anomalous)

## Purpose
Provides standardized framework for consistent, evidence-based and dynamic evaluation while maintaining scientific rigor across the full spectrum of possibilities.

## Context
The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to increase ISO detections from a few over the past decade to potentially one per few months, demanding a systematic classification scheme.

## The Loeb Scale: Detailed Criteria (0-10)

### GREEN ZONE (Levels 0-1): Natural Objects

**Level 0 - Insignificant (White)**
- Consistent with known natural phenomena
- No anomalies detected

**Level 1 - Normal Natural Variation (Green)**
- Minor deviations, likely natural variations
- Within expected range of natural objects

### YELLOW ZONE (Levels 2-4): Anomalous Objects

**Level 2 - Meriting Attention (Yellow)**
- Non-gravitational acceleration exceeding cometary models
- Single major anomaly in trajectory, composition, or morphology
- Non-gravitational acceleration marginally inconsistent with measured outgassing

**Level 3 - High Confidence Anomaly (Yellow)**
- Non-gravitational acceleration vastly exceeding maximum cometary outgassing given absence or weakness of visible coma
- Multiple persistent anomalies across observable categories
- No satisfactory natural explanation after comprehensive analysis

**Level 4 - Anomaly Meeting Potential Technosignature Criteria (Yellow)**
*Critical threshold where technosignature indicators enter formal consideration*
- Non-gravitational acceleration exceeding cometary models
- Spectral signatures absent in known asteroid taxonomy, including anomalous spectrum inconsistent with solar reflection
- Albedo variations inconsistent with known materials
- Deviation from Keplerian hyperbolic orbit inconsistent with outgassing models
- Unusual shape inferred from lightcurve of reflected sunlight
- Trajectory anomalously aligned with planetary orbital planes or selective inner planet targeting

### ORANGE ZONE (Levels 5-7): Suspected Technology

**Level 5 - Suspected Passive Technology (Orange)**
- Unusual speed
- Strong, persistent indicators of artificial, non-operational origin
- Surface composition inconsistent with cosmic-ray bombardment for implied age or velocity
- Absence of cometary activity despite substantial non-gravitational acceleration

**Level 6 - Suspected Active Technology (Orange)**
- Level 5 criteria PLUS at least one of:
  - Signs of being operational (e.g., maneuvers, signals)
  - Electromagnetic signals of non-natural origin
  - Trajectory changes incompatible with gravitational or outgassing models
  - Detection of deployed sub-objects
  - Artificial illumination or heat that cannot be explained by solar irradiation

**Level 7 - Suspected Active Technology with Unclear Intent (Orange)**
- Level 6 criteria PLUS at least one of:
  - Responsive behavior to observations
  - Signals of unknown purpose
  - Operational intent that cannot be determined or appears potentially hostile

### RED ZONE (Levels 8-10): Confirmed Technology

**Level 8 - Confirmed Technology (No Impact) (Red)**
- Direct investigation confirms extraterrestrial artificial origin
- No collision trajectory
- *Represents humanity's most profound potential discovery*

**Level 9 - Confirmed Technology (Regional Impact) (Red)**
- Confirmed extraterrestrial artificial origin
- Impact trajectory with regional consequences

**Level 10 - Confirmed Technology (Global Impact) (Red)**
- Confirmed extraterrestrial artificial origin
- Impact trajectory with global terrestrial consequences

## Test Case Classifications

- **1I/'Oumuamua:** Level 4 (anomalous, potential technosignature indicators)
- **2I/Borisov:** Level 0 (natural, consistent with known comets)
- **3I/ATLAS:** Level 4 (anomalous, potential technosignature indicators)

## Key Assessment Principles

1. **Sequential Progression:** Objects must meet all criteria for Levels 0-3 sequentially
2. **Level Skipping Allowed:** For Levels 4-10, objects may skip levels if higher-level indicators are definitively observed
3. **Evidence-Based:** Classification requires convergent evidence across multiple observables
4. **Dynamic Evaluation:** Classifications can change as new data becomes available

## Observable Categories for Assessment

1. **Trajectory Anomalies:** Deviations from gravitational models, non-gravitational acceleration
2. **Spectroscopic Signatures:** Unusual spectra, artificial illumination indicators
3. **Geometric Properties:** Unusual shapes from lightcurves, aspect ratios
4. **Surface Composition:** Material inconsistencies, weathering patterns
5. **Electromagnetic Signals:** Non-natural frequency emissions
6. **Operational Indicators:** Maneuvers, deployed sub-objects, responsive behavior
