Note. The Loeb Scale extends the Torino Scale to address ISOs, incorporating technological
origin assessment. Color coding follows standard risk communication protocols. Level 4 marks
the critical threshold where technosignature indicators trigger enhanced observational
campaigns. Objects must meet all criteria for Levels 0-3 sequentially. For Levels 4-10, objects
may skip levels if higher-level indicators are definitively observed (e.g., electromagnetic signals
would justify direct Level 6 classification).
Levels 0-4
The Loeb Scale's architecture divides into three zones reflecting increasing deviation
from expected natural phenomena. The Green Zone encompasses Levels 0-1, representing

5

objects consistent with known natural processes, though Level 1 allows for minor unexplained
variations. The Yellow Zone, covering Levels 2-4, addresses objects with increasingly
significant anomalies. Level 2 captures single major deviations, such as trajectory anomalies
exceeding gravitational models. Level 3 indicates multiple persistent anomalies, particularly nongravitational accelerations that significantly exceed cometary outgassing limits.
The critical threshold occurs at Level 4, where technosignature indicators enter formal
consideration. This level requires meeting Level 3 criteria plus additional features weakly
consistent with artificial origin, such as spectral signatures absent from known asteroid
taxonomies, albedo variations inconsistent with natural materials, unusual shape from lightcurve
variations, or trajectory alignments with planetary orbital planes having a low probability. Level
4 represents the critical juncture where scientific curiosity must expand to include strategic
considerations, the point at which 'What is it?' necessarily becomes 'What does it mean for
humanity?' Though remaining within the Yellow Zone as these indicators require verification.
Levels 5-7
The Orange Zone encompasses Levels 5-7, marking the qualitative shift to suspected
artificial origin requiring immediate strategic response. Level 5 applies when strong persistent
indicators suggest artificial but non-operational technology, such as surface compositions
inconsistent with expected cosmic ray bombardment or absence of cometary activity despite
substantial non-gravitational acceleration. Level 6 elevates the classification when operational
signs emerge, including electromagnetic emissions across non-natural frequencies, evidence of
propulsion, or detection of deployed sub-probes. Level 7 addresses the complex scenario where
technology is confirmed but intent remains unclear or potentially hostile, where detection itself
may carry risks.

Unlike Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) that offer mostly years of observational opportunity,
the hyperbolic trajectories of ISOs limit observational windows to months or weeks, requiring
prepared response protocols. The distinction between natural and technological objects relies on
convergent evidence across multiple observables. Following Loeb (2025b), key technosignature
indicators include: propulsion signatures causing deviations from gravitational trajectories that
exceed cometary outgassing limits; trajectories selectively targeting inner planets or exhibiting
improbable alignments with the ecliptic plane; spectral signatures distinguishing artificial
illumination or internal heat sources from reflected sunlight; anomalous shapes inferred from
lightcurves; surface compositions inconsistent with expected interstellar weathering;
electromagnetic signals across artificial frequencies; and evidence of deployed sub-probes. These
criteria inform the progression from Level 4 (initial indicators) through Level 8 (confirmed
technology).
Levels 8-10
The Red Zone, Levels 8-10, manages post-confirmation scenarios differentiated by
impact potential. Level 8, confirmed technology posing no impact threat, has no Torino analog
but represents humanity's most profound potential discovery. We advise mandatory immediate
data release to prevent information hoarding and ensuring discoveries remain the “province of all
mankind” per the Outer Space Treaty (United Nations, 1967, Article I). Levels 9 and 10 address
regional and global terrestrial impact scenarios respectively, invoking emergency protocols that
transcend typical natural disaster response given the added complexity of technological
causation, whether from malfunction or intent.
