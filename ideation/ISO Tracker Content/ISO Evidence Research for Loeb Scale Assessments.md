### 1I/'Oumuamua - Key Evidence

**Source:** Micheli et al., Nature 559, 223–226 (2018)

**Non-Gravitational Acceleration:**
- Detected at 30σ significance (extremely high confidence)
- Heliocentric radial acceleration proportional to r^-2 or r^-1
- Magnitude: ~2.7 × 10^-6 m/s^2 at r = 1.4 AU
- 3-4 orders of magnitude weaker than gravitational acceleration

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Unusually elongated shape
- Tumbling rotation state
- Surface properties resemble cometary nuclei
- NO evidence of cometary activity (no coma, no tail)

**Ruled Out Explanations:**
- Solar radiation pressure
- Drag and friction-like forces
- Solar wind interaction (highly magnetized object)
- Geometric effects (multiple bodies or photocentre offset)

**Proposed Explanation:**
- Comet-like outgassing (but no visible coma observed)
- Requires thermal properties similar to comets

**Anomaly:** Exhibits cometary-like acceleration WITHOUT visible cometary activity


### 2I/Borisov - Key Evidence

**Source:** NASA Science (https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/2i-borisov/)

**Discovery:**
- Discovered August 30, 2019 by Gennady Borisov (Crimean amateur astronomer)
- First confirmed interstellar comet
- Speed: ~110,000 mph (177,000 km/h)

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Size: ~3,200 feet (975 meters) across
- Visible coma (dust-filled cloud of gas)
- Active outgassing (normal cometary behavior)
- Fragment broke off nucleus in March 2020

**Composition (from other sources):**
- High CO/H2O ratio (>173%, 3x higher than Solar System comets)
- Similar spectroscopy to Oort Cloud comets
- C2-depleted
- Classic cometary behavior with clear coma and tail

**Key Difference from 'Oumuamua:**
- "Whereas 'Oumuamua appeared to be a rock, Borisov is really active, more like a normal comet" - David Jewitt, UCLA

**Loeb Scale Assessment: 0-1 (Natural)**
- Exhibits all expected characteristics of a natural comet
- No anomalous behavior
- Composition matches Solar System comets (though with some variations)
- Clear evidence of cometary activity


### 3I/ATLAS - Key Evidence

**Source:** NASA Science + Avi Loeb Medium article (Oct 2025)

**Discovery:**
- Discovered July 1, 2025 by ATLAS survey telescope in Chile
- Pre-discovery observations extend back to June 14, 2025
- Perihelion: October 29, 2025 at 1.4 AU (inside Mars orbit)

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Size: 1,444 feet to 3.5 miles diameter (440m to 5.6km)
- Rotation period: 16.2 hours
- Teardrop-shaped dust cocoon
- Hyperbolic trajectory (interstellar origin confirmed)

**The 8 Anomalies (Avi Loeb's Assessment - Loeb Scale Level 4):**

1. **Ecliptic Alignment:** Trajectory aligned within 5° of ecliptic plane (0.2% probability)

2. **Sunward Jet (Anti-tail):** Displayed unusual sunward jet in July-August 2025, not an optical illusion

3. **Extreme Size/Speed:** ~1 million times more massive than 'Oumuamua, 1000x more massive than Borisov, moving faster than both (<0.1% probability)

4. **Fine-tuned Arrival:** Timing brought it close to Mars, Venus, Jupiter while unobservable from Earth at perihelion (0.005% probability)

5. **Unusual Composition:** Much more nickel than iron (like industrial alloys), Ni/CN ratio orders of magnitude higher than all known comets (<1% probability)

6. **Low Water Content:** Only 4% water by mass (comets typically much higher)

7. **Extreme Negative Polarization:** Unprecedented for all known comets including Borisov (<1% probability)

8. **Wow! Signal Alignment:** Arrived from direction of famous "Wow! Signal" within 9° (0.6% probability)

**Cumulative Probability:** Less than 1 in 10 quadrillion (10^-16)

**Loeb Scale Assessment: Level 4 (Anomalous)**
- Not definitively natural (Level 0-1)
- Not definitively technological (Level 8-10)
- Sits in "anomalous" range requiring further investigation
