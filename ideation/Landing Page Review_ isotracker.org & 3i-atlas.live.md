## Landing Page Review: isotracker.org & 3i-atlas.live

### Executive Summary

**Verdict: Significant Changes Required.**

While the landing pages are visually well-designed, they are critically misaligned with the evolved platform strategy outlined in the `architecture.md` and `product-description.md` documents. The current pages are promoting a product with the wrong pricing, features, and strategic positioning. 

**Key Issues:**
1.  **Pricing is incorrect:** The tiers and prices shown on `isotracker.org` do not match the new business model.
2.  **Core Value Proposition is missing:** The unique "Evidence Assessment Framework" is not explained, weakening the product's primary differentiator.
3.  **Two-Domain Strategy is not implemented:** `3i-atlas.live` is a redirect, not a standalone email capture page, defeating its strategic purpose.

This review will detail the specific gaps and provide actionable recommendations for each page.

### isotracker.org: Analysis & Recommendations

**Overall Score: 60% (Needs Major Revisions)**

#### What's Working Well
*   **Hero Messaging:** The headline "Are We Alone? Track the Answer" is strong, emotional, and perfectly aligned with the brand.
*   **Loeb Scale Section:** This is excellent. It's visually appealing, informative, and effectively communicates the scientific backing of the platform.
*   **General Design:** The dark theme, typography, and layout are professional and engaging.

#### Critical Gaps & Required Changes

**1. Pricing & Tier Misalignment (CRITICAL)**

This is the most urgent issue. The landing page is selling a product that doesn't exist at prices that are wrong.

| | **Current Landing Page** | **Correct Product Strategy** | **Status** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | Explorer ($4.99/mo) | **Event Pass ($4.99/mo)** | ⚠️ **Name & Messaging Mismatch** |
| **Tier 2** | Analyst ($9.99/mo) | **Evidence Analyst ($19/mo)** | ❌ **WRONG PRICE & NAME** |
| **Tier 3** | Professional ($19.99/mo) | *(Does not exist)* | ❌ **TIER IS OBSOLETE** |

**Recommendations:**
*   **Remove the "Professional" tier immediately.**
*   **Update the "Analyst" tier:** Change the name to **"Evidence Analyst"** and the price from **$9.99/mo to $19/mo**.
*   **Update the "Explorer" tier:** Change the name to **"Event Pass"** and add messaging that it is **VIEW-ONLY** for the evidence framework and **auto-pauses** between events.

**2. Missing Core Value Proposition**

The landing page mentions "Community Debate" but fails to explain the sophisticated **Evidence Assessment Framework**, which is the platform's primary differentiator.

**Recommendations:**
*   Create a new section titled **"Go Beyond Speculation: The Evidence Framework"**.
*   Visually explain the two-step process:
    *   **Step 1: Assess Quality** (Show the 3-tier rubric: Chain of Custody, Witness Credibility, Technical Analysis).
    *   **Step 2: Cast Your Verdict** (Show the "alien | natural | uncertain" choice).
*   Introduce the concept of **"Community Sentiment vs. Scientific Consensus"** as a key benefit.

### 3i-atlas.live: Analysis & Recommendations

**Overall Score: 20% (Incorrect Implementation)**

#### The Core Problem: It's a Redirect, Not a Landing Page

The domain `3i-atlas.live` currently redirects to `isotracker.org/3i-atlas`. This completely negates the two-domain strategy, which was designed to:
*   Create a simple, high-conversion funnel for event-specific traffic.
*   Build a separate SEO footprint for the "3I/ATLAS" keyword.
*   Mitigate risk by having a separate, lightweight page for email capture.

#### Required Changes

**The `3i-atlas.live` page must be rebuilt as a standalone, single-page website.**

**Recommended Structure:**
*   **Headline:** "3I/ATLAS is passing through our solar system RIGHT NOW."
*   **Sub-headline:** "Get real-time alerts when new evidence drops."
*   **Primary Element:** A single, prominent email input field with a "Notify Me" button.
*   **Social Proof:** "Join 12,000+ observers tracking the third interstellar object."
*   **Footer Link:** A small, unobtrusive link: "Powered by isotracker.org".

**This page should have no other navigation, features, or complex content.** Its sole purpose is to convert viral interest into a qualified email list for the main platform.

### Summary of Action Items

**Priority 1: `isotracker.org` (High Urgency)**
1.  **Correct the Pricing Tiers:** This is a showstopper. The prices and tiers must match the product description.
2.  **Add the Evidence Framework Section:** Clearly articulate the core value proposition.

**Priority 2: `3i-atlas.live` (Medium Urgency)**
1.  **Remove the Redirect:** Point the domain to a new, standalone server/hosting instance.
2.  **Build the Email Capture Page:** Create the simple, high-conversion page described above.

**Conclusion:**

The platform has made significant strategic progress. The landing pages must now be updated to reflect this evolution. Fixing the pricing and clearly communicating the unique evidence framework on `isotracker.org` are the most critical next steps to ensure a successful launch.
