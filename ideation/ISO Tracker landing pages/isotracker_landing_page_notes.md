## Key Observations

### Strengths
- Clean, professional design
- Clear value propositions
- Multiple CTAs throughout
- 3-tier pricing structure visible
- 3I/ATLAS prominently featured

### Potential Issues
- **Positioning:** "Evidence-Based Analysis" feels academic/dry vs. our "Track Interstellar Visitors. Join the Search for Alien Life" positioning
- **Pricing Mismatch:** Shows $4.99 "Event Pass" and $19 "Evidence Analyst" but missing the $9.99 "Analyst" tier from our value ladder
- **Missing Features:** No mention of:
  - AR sky tracking
  - "Alien vs. Natural" debate/voting
  - Real-time tracking visualization
  - Community forum/Discord
- **Tone:** Very scientific/serious vs. our more accessible, wonder-driven approach
- **CTA Confusion:** Multiple CTAs ("Start Free", "Get Started", "Create Free Account") may dilute conversion
