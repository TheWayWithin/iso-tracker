# 3i-atlas.live Landing Page Review Notes

**URL:** http://3i-atlas.live (redirects to https://www.isotracker.org/3i-atlas)
**Date Reviewed:** 2025-11-18

## Important Discovery
**The domain 3i-atlas.live redirects to isotracker.org/3i-atlas** - This is actually a subpage of the main ISO Tracker site, not a separate landing page.

## Page Structure

### Hero Section
- **Badge:** "OBSERVATION WINDOW APPROACHING" (yellow/gold)
- **Headline:** "3I/ATLAS"
- **Subheadline:** "The third confirmed interstellar object is entering our solar system."
- **Description:** "After 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, this is your chance to participate in evidence-based analysis as history unfolds."
- **CTAs:** "Join the Analysis" (primary, purple), "View Timeline" (secondary)

### What We Know Section
Four key stats displayed as cards:
1. **3rd** - Interstellar Object
2. **2025** - Observation Window
3. **TBD** - Origin Classification
4. **Live** - NASA JPL Tracking

### The Central Question Section
Presents three classification options:
1. **Natural Origin** - "Comet or asteroid ejected from another star system" (green)
2. **Uncertain** - "Insufficient evidence for definitive classification" (yellow)
3. **Artificial Origin** - "Technology or construction from intelligent beings" (red)

### Observation Timeline
Four-phase timeline:
1. **Discovery** - Initial Detection (completed)
2. **Analysis** - Evidence Collection (completed)
3. **Current** - Pre-Observation Window (current phase)
4. **Upcoming** - Peak Observation Window (future)

### Why This Matters Section
Four value propositions:
1. **Scientific Precedent** - Third confirmed ISO, methodology sets standards
2. **Evidence-Based Analysis** - Structured evaluation vs social media speculation
3. **Community Consensus** - Real-time scientific community input
4. **Be Part of History** - Rare opportunity (once per decade)

### Final CTA Section
- **Headline:** "Don't Miss the Window"
- **Description:** "Sign up now to receive alerts when the observation window opens. Be ready to analyze evidence as it becomes available."
- **CTAs:** "Create Free Account", "Learn More About ISO Tracker"

### Footer
- Links: "Home", "Guidelines", "Browse ISOs"

## Key Observations

### Strengths
- **Event-specific focus** - Entirely dedicated to 3I/ATLAS
- **Urgency messaging** - "Observation Window Approaching" creates FOMO
- **Clear timeline** - Shows where we are in the discovery process
- **The Central Question** - Presents the debate framework visually
- **Historical context** - References 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov

### Issues
- **Redirect Strategy** - 3i-atlas.live redirects to isotracker.org/3i-atlas instead of being a standalone landing page
  - This loses the benefit of having a dedicated, event-specific domain
  - Misses opportunity for separate SEO and marketing campaigns
- **Same positioning problem** - "Evidence-based analysis" tone (academic/dry)
- **Missing features** - No mention of:
  - Sky tracking or AR features
  - Real-time position visualization
  - Observation planning tools
  - The actual tracking functionality
- **No email capture** - Final CTA goes to "Create Free Account" instead of simple email capture
- **Passive engagement** - Presents the debate but doesn't invite users to vote/participate actively
