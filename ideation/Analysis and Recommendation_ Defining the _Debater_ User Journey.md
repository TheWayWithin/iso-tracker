## Analysis and Recommendation: Defining the "Debater" User Journey

This document provides a definitive analysis of the "Debater" user journey and makes a clear recommendation for the product's sign-up and monetization model, based on the strategic foundation established in the positioning statement, client success blueprint, and architecture documents.

### The Core Insight from Strategic Documents

Your existing strategic documents are remarkably consistent on one key point: the **Spectator → Debater** lifecycle is a **behavioral journey**, not a direct mapping to pricing tiers. The goal is to convert free Spectators (acquired virally during events) into engaged Debaters (retained between events). The pricing tiers are the **tools** that facilitate and enhance this journey.

*   **Positioning Statement:** Defines the "Debater" as the retention stage, driven by the need for an "evidence analysis framework."
*   **Client Success Blueprint:** Describes the "Debater" as someone who values "scientific rigor over sensationalism."
*   **Architecture:** The RLS policies are designed to gate specific *capabilities* (like inserting into the `evidence_assessments` table), not general participation.

### Recommendation: Option B is the Only Correct Choice

Based on this strategic foundation, **Option B: Debater = Behavior (Free for Everyone)** is the only model that aligns with your business strategy. Options A and C would fundamentally break your acquisition and retention model.

**The Corrected User Journey:**

1.  **Spectator (Free):**
    *   **Action:** Arrives during an ISO event. Can view the ISO tracker, read news, and **read** community discussions.
    *   **Motivation:** Curiosity. "What is this thing? Is it aliens?"
    *   **Goal:** Convert them to a registered user.

2.  **Registered User (Free):**
    *   **Action:** Signs up for a free account. Can now **submit basic arguments/opinions** and participate in general discussion forums. This is the moment they behaviorally become a "Debater."
    *   **Motivation:** Participation. "I have an opinion, and I want to share it."
    *   **Goal:** Get them engaged in the core community loop.

3.  **Event Pass Holder ($4.99/mo):**
    *   **Action:** Upgrades to get enhanced participation tools. They can now **vote** on community arguments (influencing the Community Sentiment score) and get real-time alerts.
    *   **Motivation:** Influence. "I want my opinion to count, and I want to be the first to know."
    *   **Goal:** Monetize initial engagement and identify power users.

4.  **Evidence Analyst ($19/mo):**
    *   **Action:** Upgrades to access the core value proposition. They can now use the **Evidence Assessment Framework** to submit structured, scored analyses. Their input is weighted and contributes to the **Scientific Consensus** score.
    *   **Motivation:** Rigor & Status. "I want to move beyond opinion and use a professional framework to analyze the data myself."
    *   **Goal:** Retain the most committed users and generate sustainable revenue.

### Why This Model Works

*   **Builds a Community Moat:** By allowing free participation (Option B), you maximize community size and engagement. The content and debates generated by free users become a powerful moat that competitors cannot easily replicate.
*   **Aligns with Acquisition Strategy:** Your $0 CAC model relies on a low-friction entry point. Forcing users to pay just to voice an opinion (Option A) would kill viral growth.
*   **Creates a Clear Value Ladder:** The journey is simple and logical:
    *   Read for free.
    *   Opine for free.
    *   Pay to **influence** (vote).
    *   Pay to **analyze** (use the framework).
*   **Minimizes Technical Complexity:** This model is simpler to implement than the usage-based limits of Option C. The architecture's RLS policies are already designed to gate capabilities, not count actions.

### Implementation Guidance for Sprint 1

Based on this definitive choice of **Option B**, the technical requirements for the authentication and authorization system are clear:

1.  **Anonymous Users (Spectators):** Can read all public content (ISO tracks, news, community arguments).
2.  **Authenticated Free Users (Debaters - Behavioral):**
    *   Can perform all Spectator actions.
    *   Can INSERT into a `comments` or `arguments` table (basic text opinions).
3.  **Event Pass Users:**
    *   Can perform all free user actions.
    *   Can INSERT/UPDATE a `votes` table linked to arguments.
    *   Receive real-time notifications.
4.  **Evidence Analyst Users:**
    *   Can perform all Event Pass actions.
    *   Can INSERT into the `evidence_assessments` table (the core, structured data).

This provides a clear and strategically aligned path forward for development.
